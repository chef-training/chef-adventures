# ChefDK Adventures

> Resting in this hallowed repository lay the stories of legend.

ChefDK Adventures is an interactive training experience.  It can be done solo or with an instructor. The instructor is sometimes referred to as CM (Chef Master).

The learner is the protagonist of this story. Laid before them are a series of obstacles that require them to use Chef tools and practices to overcome them.

The content is separated into episodes.

  + Refactoring Chef cookbooks for fun and profit
  + Turn hello world into something useful
  + Let's put your hostname and ip address into the homepage
  + How do we get our public IP address?
  + Use the AWS metadata endpoint from within a VM
    - curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
  + Now that we have the public IP, we can load the homepage in a browser
  + Hard-code the hostname and public IP into the HTML code
  + What about other info like memory, CPU, etc?
  + Use this script to generate new HTML code to show all the data:
    - curl -L http://tinyurl.com/my-sysinfo-sh -o sysinfo.sh
    - sh sysinfo.sh
    - copy the output, put it into the 'file' resource in our recipe
  + Move the HTML code out of our recipe and into a template resource
  + Generate a template file
    - chef generate template index.html
    - edit index.html.erb in Atom
    - Change 'file' in the recipe resource to 'template'
    - Remove the 'content' line and replace with 'source'
  + Add the availability zone to the file.  How can we capture this?  (hint: metadata)

### Episode 3: üê±  Your Familiar, Ohai: Dynamic Attributes
  + Separate code from variables (attributes)
  + Introducing Ohai
  + Learn about node attributes
  + Refactor status page to use node attributes instead of hard-coded values

  + They can run `ohai | less` on their node to see all the available attributes

### Episode 4: Shall We Play a Game? üçî  üëæ
  + We've learned about machine-generated attributes in the previous section
  + Learn about customizable attributes
  + Generate an attributes file
  + Put an embeddable game from Kongregate on your site:  http://www.kongregate.com/games_for_your_site

## Contributing

So the scene that you may have just read inspired you to contribute. Good I'm glad. That's that this project needs. We need to bring more detail to that above scene. We also need to write more scenes. We could also use challenges for the player.
