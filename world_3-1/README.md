# World 3-1

## Start the game

* Install Docker

```bash
$ play
```

OR

```bash
$ docker build .
...
...
Successfully built DOCKER_IMAGE_ID
$ docker run -it DOCKER_IMAGE_ID
```

## Running it locally

You can kind of run it locally. It's a really a big mess. Particularly because this version of the game requires the modified `bashrc`. But give it a try with...

```bash
$ ruby wake.rb
```
